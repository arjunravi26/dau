`dau-undersampling` is a Python package that implements **Density-Aware Undersampling (DAU)**, a novel undersampling technique for handling imbalanced datasets.
It intelligently reduces the majority class by:
- Keeping sparse (boundary / hard-to-learn) points.
- Clustering dense regions using **DBSCAN** and selecting one representative per cluster.
- Preserving noise and outliers.

This ensures that your classifier learns from diverse and informative samples without being overwhelmed by redundant majority-class points.
